Getting this library installed and ready-to-go should only take a few minutes. If it
ever becomes a pain in the ass, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/asotog88/cradlecore-ioc/issues/new) (or submit a pull request)
describing the issue you encountered and how we might make the process easier.

### Requirements

This library requires one of the following PHP versions:
<ul>
    <li>5.3</li>
    <li>5.4</li>
    <li>5.5</li>
</ul>

## Where it can be installed ?

We recommend to [download](https://github.com/asotog88/cradlecore-ioc/releases/tag/v1.0.0) the library, and then place it out of the http web server root folder to avoid its visibility from some outcoming request, one recommended place is to use the [PEAR include path](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.checking.php) to put the library contents.
